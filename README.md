# :robot: Loops and Conditionals

## ü§ì Overview and learning outcomes 

Decision making and iteration are the key to robotics applications.  Finally, we will begin to build some "intelligence" into the programs we will write in Python.  In this lab you will learn to use loops and conditionals like `while`, `for`, `if`, `elif` and `else` as well as **Boolean Arguments**.

The goal of this lab assignment is to introduce you to loops and conditionals so you may begin to build some complexity into your programs. üöÄ

#### Over the course of this lab you will do a number of things:
1. Practice using `while` and `for` loops for iteration.
2. Begin to practice with conditionals.
3. Build Boolean Arguments for robotic decision making.
4. Utilize Git on your Raspberry Pi to make changes.

## üíª Terms to know
- conditionals
- loops
- iteration
- `for`
- `while`
- `if`
- `else`
- `elif`
- Boolean Arguments
- indentation

## üìù Next steps
1. Complete the work in the notebook here (5.4.1-Python_Programs_Variables_Strings.ipynb) using the CoLab interface.
2. Using GIT, add the repo to your raspberry pi.
3. Using NANO and the terminal in your pi, create a new text file called "observations.txt" and write what you learned in this lab.
4. Commit and Push the code to your repo so that I will be able to read your new text file from GitHub.
